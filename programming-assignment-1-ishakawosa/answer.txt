File Transfer Analysis:

# 1 (1.csv):

File Size: 284,379 bytes

Buffer Size (-m) = 500
Transfer Time: 37 milliseconds

Buffer Size (-m) = 1000
Transfer Time: 17 milliseconds

Buffer Size (-m) = 2000
Transfer Time: 12 milliseconds

The experiments with "1.csv" demonstrated that varying the buffer size had an impact on transfer times for a relatively small file. 
As expected, larger buffer sizes led to faster transfers, significantly reducing the time required to complete the process.

# 2 (test1.bin):

File Size: 100,000,000 bytes (100MB)

Buffer Size (-m) = 500
Transfer Time: 9,577 milliseconds (approximately 9.6 seconds)

Buffer Size (-m) = 1000
Transfer Time: 5,627 milliseconds (approximately 5.6 seconds)

Buffer Size (-m) = 2000
Transfer Time: 4,259 milliseconds (approximately 4.3 seconds)

Buffer Size (-m) = 3000
Transfer Time: 2,905 milliseconds (approximately 2.9 seconds)

The experiments with "test1.bin" revealed a similar trend to those with "1.csv." Increasing the buffer size significantly reduced transfer times for the large file. 
Also "test1.bin" takes longer time to transfer than "1.csv." because of the larger size of the file.


The main bottleneck is the buffer size (-m).
